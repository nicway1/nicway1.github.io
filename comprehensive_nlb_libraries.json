      "Formerly the Central Lending Library at Stamford Road, in 2005 the library was relocated to Victoria Street and opened as the Central Public Library. It closed again on 13 June 2022 for its first full overhaul and was reopened on 12 Jan 2024 by Mrs Josephine Teo, Minister for Communications and Information. Reflecting its location in the Bras Basah.Bugis (BBB) arts and heritage district, the revamped library has a strong local emphasis on Singapore culture and literature as well as a focus on sustainability which is anchored by the Children's Biodiversity Library by S.E.A. Aquarium."

      "The Marine Parade Community Library was opened on 10 November 1978 by Mr Goh Chok Tong, then Senior Minister of State (Finance) and Member of Parliament for Marine Parade. It was the third full-time library built by the National Library under its plan to decentralise home reading services and to bring the library nearer to the people. In 2000, it shifted to be co-located with the Marine Parade Community Complex, where it occupied 3 1/2 stories floors. The library closed for renovations from 9 May 2022 and will reopen in the same location in 2025."

      "Before the new library at Pasir Ris was set up in 2000, many residents in the area were young, married couples with at least one child. The library was thus developed with the aim of reaching out to the large number of young families in the area. Our library, located at White Sands Shopping Centre, was officially opened on 6 October 2000. It underwent renovations in 2015 and was officially reopened by then Deputy Prime Minister Teo Chee Hean on 28 November 2015."
